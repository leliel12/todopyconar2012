I really enjoyed the conference. I think the organizers did an excellent job at
planning the talks, managing the time, planning travel for the international
speakers, and make the entire experience. I also enjoyed the conference venue.
It reminded me of when I was a student in Pisa, where I remember a vibrant
student community, as I saw in Argentina.

I enjoyed most of the talks I saw and there is no doubt there are some top
Python developers there. I did not particularly enjoy talks without code,
given that this is a conference about programming, and I have seen a few.

For the future I think that some things can be improved:
    1. require that all speakers clarify in advance whether they are doing a
       tutorial about something they have learned themselves or they speak
       about something new they have developed.
    2. require that they clarify the level of the talk (basic, intermediate,
       advanced).
    3. I know it is difficult to get international speakers but you may want
       to consider organizing some panel discussions and perhaps have some
       international speakers send you videos (instead of attending in person)
       and follow up with a local discussion.

The variety of talks on both content and on english/spanish was nice (the
english particularly helpful to me of course). The breaks between talks was
nicely timed allowing for good conversation in between. Some feedback on areas
that could be improved possibly:

    - The location of the PgDay was great, close to the hotel made it very easy.
    - In getting to and from PyCon a couple of smaller buses could make it
      easier so people could arrive later or leave earlier, it makes it a bit
      easier to coordinate for non-locals.
    - The first day of PyCon was a bit confusing with the classes going on at
      the university, it made it harder to casually talk with others as it was
      unclear if they were there for the conference.
    - More power cables, running extra extension cords and surge protectors in
      the talk rooms would be awesome.

This is obviously from a skewed perspective of an invited speaker who barely
speaks Spanish, but here it goes:

**The Good:** Everyone was very friendly! The conference was not overwhelming in
terms of size (reminded me of the early PyCon US where you could actually find
people who wanted to find easily). Sprinting was a good size and group of
people.

**The Bad:** Not enough seating with power for working on a laptop when there
wasn't a talk I wan't to attend. Not enough talks in English
(as I said, skewed =). Would have been great to have a list of good tourist
attractions to see that were near the hotel (e.g. museums, art galleries, etc.
that were within reasonable walking distance). A map of places to eat near the
conference since lunch was not provided and it was not in a major part of the
city where there were an obvious bunch of places to eat.
